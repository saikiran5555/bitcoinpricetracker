# BITCOIN PRICE TRACKER

A cryptocurrency price tracker monitors the current value of digital currencies, in addition to information about market capitalization, trading volume, price charts, and other types of data. A cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange, it is digital and uses encryption techniques to control the creation of monetary units and to verify the transfer of funds. Bitcoin is the name of the best-known cryptocurrency. People are frequently unaware of cryptocurrencies, or are unaware of them at all, and many regard bitcoin as a criminal activity. As information and communication technology advances at a breakneck pace, many aspects of our everyday lives have been digitized, making them more expandable and productive. Cryptocurrency is a safe, popular, and standardized means to transact from anywhere on the planet, with relatively minimal fees. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is not backed by any country's central bank or government. It can be traded for goods or services with vendors who accept bitcoins as payment. This data is transferred from one person to another and verifying the transaction, i.e., spending the money that requires high computing power to safely verify the individual transactions. The P2P network monitors and verifies the transfer of bitcoins between users. It can be used to book hotels, shopping, financial transactions, buy video games, etc. The Bitcoin price is determined through supply and demand. A finite supply of bitcoin mitigates inflation and deflation risks.   

PURPOSE:

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that uses cryptography for security and is not controlled by any government or financial institution. It was created in 2008 by an individual or group of individuals using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto (2008) with a paper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Electronic Cash System”. Bitcoin price prediction has been an active area of research for a long time. Bitcoin, as a pioneer within the blockchain monetary renaissance, plays an overwhelming part in an entirety cryptocurrency market capitalization environment. Bitcoin is not issued by a central bank or backed by a government, therefore, the monetary policy tools, inflation rates, and economic growth measurements that typically influence the value of a currency do not apply to Bitcoin. Bitcoin acts as more of a commodity. Every transaction involving Bitcoin is tracked on the blockchain, which is similar to a bank's ledger, or log of customers' funds going in and out of the bank. In simple terms, it's a record of every transaction ever made using Bitcoin. The objective of Bitcoin Prediction is to ascertain with what accuracy can the price of Bitcoin be predicted using different machine learning algorithm and compare their accuracy. Hence, it is the incredible interest of machine learning and data mining community to be able to: (I) Predict Bitcoin price changes (II) Grant experiences to get it what drives the Bitcoin instability and way better assess related dangers in cryptocurrency domain. 

AIM:

→The aim of the project is to develop an application in which users can track the price  of Bitcoin in Real Time.

→This application tracks bitcoin price with maximum efficiency using API.

→It ensure less risk and more profit for investors.

→This flow model uses the current circulation of Bitcoin and the rate of production to measure the effect of scarcity on the Bitcoin price.


SCOPE:

↪Today Bitcoin is a secure transaction system that has a valuable impact on capital.

↪They are awarded under a restriction in which customers offer their computer authority to register and listing trades with the bitcoins.

↪The purchase and sale of Bitcoins in different currencies is carried out in an alternative workplace where "purchase" or "sell" requests are placed in the ordered e-book.

↪In the current societal and economic climate there is a growing incentive to hold less cash and be hedged against intense market swings.

↪Recently, a trend started where publicly traded companies were beginning to convert cash in their treasuries over to Bitcoin as a more sound store-of-value.

↪As per the financial investment experts, is expected that Bitcoin will reach to an unimaginable 21 million by the end of 2040.

↪There is much scope for the evolution of Bitcoin during the next 10 years. It will be imperative for the investors to focus closely on several areas in the ecosystem of Bitcoin at present.


PROPOSED SYSTEM:

•In this system we are introducing a python module to overcome the drawbacks of existing project.

•Any search engine shows users the Bitcoin price.

•But it does not tell users the exact price of that particular time.

•To overcome this problem, we are proposing a system that tracks the Bitcoin price in real time.

•We are going to develop an website-based application, in which users can track the price of Bitcoin in real-time and also they can see the current price by refreshing the page in real-time.

•We are providing user an eco-friendly system that shows the user Bitcoin price in real-time.


METHODOLOGY:


1.Python

2.Tkinter

3.Request

4.Date and time


APPLICATIONS:


1.Protection from inflation.

2.Self-governance and managed.

3.Provides user-friendly interface so that users may buy, sell, exchange Bitcoins.

4.Independent and Security.

5.Help to gauge user gains in real time.


IMPLEMENTATION:


In this we are using the Technologies and creating an website-based application to track the Bitcoin Price in real-time. The following Technologies are:

1.Python language is used to develop the Application: “Bitcoin Price Tracker".

2.Tkinter is used to create the GUI for the Application.

3.The 'requests’ module allows us to send HTTP request using python.

4.‘Datetime’ module supplies classes to manipulate date and time.


RESULT:


⁕We made our project as useful for the users who needs this and all related users.

⁕We conclude result that our project is useful for those people who are tracking the Bitcoin Price in real-time.

⁕Our product is so useful that it can track the cryptocurrency Bitcoin price and it can also give the accurate price by refreshing the page.

⁕Our project’s objective is to help users who want to know the current price of Bitcoin. This in turn helps them to know the price details and makes sure that they were up to-date.

CONCLUSION:


We are finally drawn the conclusion that during the course of this project, we were able to successfully develop a Bitcoin price tracker application. This project distinguishes out from others in its field, due to the nature of its Gui as well as its capacity to precisely monitor the operation of bitcoin exchanges in a matter of milliseconds.


FUTURE SCOPE:

Bitcoin prediction is the actual demand for beneficial business as the use of cryptocurrency is growing every day. With the help of this price tracker application, investors will be able to know the changes in the prices of bitcoin beforehand. This system with little modification can be used to predict the price of any cryptocurrency in the near future. In addition to that, we are contemplating the inclusion of a few extra intricate functionalities to the project in order to provide more in-depth facts pertaining to the various cryptocurrencies.
